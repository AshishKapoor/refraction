# IBM Plex Sans and IMB Plex Serif

The font files have been downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?selection.family=IBM+Plex+Sans|IBM+Plex+Serif:400,400i,700,700i&query=IBM+plex+se)
and converted into webfonts with [FontSquirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com) using the
"optimal" setting.

The `ibmplex.css` file has been created manually to make the "IBM Plex Sans" and "IBM Plex Serif"
fonts available as a single font with regular, italic, bold, and bold-italic as supported styles.

You can directly import the CSS file to make the font available in your app.

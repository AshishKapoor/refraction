`@quid/react-popover` is a React component based upon `react-popper`,
used to quickly create popovers in your applications.

It supports all the advanced positioning provided by `react-popper`,
a "click outside" detection system to automatically close the popover
whenever the user clicks outside of it, open and close delays, and a
render-props based API to allow full customization of the component rendering.

As convenience utility, a `Container` component is exported from the paclage

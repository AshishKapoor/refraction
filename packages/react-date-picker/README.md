This component is a replacement for the HTML date picker element displayed when
a `input[type=date]` is expanded.

It is exported as a standalone package to make it easier its integration
with 3rd party code, but its suggested usage is with the [`@quid/react-forms#InputDate`](#inputdate) component.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save @quid/react-date-picker

# or

yarn add @quid/react-date-picker
```

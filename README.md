# Quid UI

[![lerna][lerna-badge]](https://lernajs.io/) [![Build Status][travis-badge]](https://travis-ci.com/quid/ui-framework)

This is the home of the front-end technologies that compose the awesome
products we build at Quid!

To see a live demo and read the documentation please visit [ui.quid.com](https://ui.quid.com).

## What can we do for you?

Companies' styleguides are usually meant to be used by the company itself, with little
benefits for the community.

Our goal with this project, instead, is to provide a lot of highly reusable libraries
that we believe will be useful to everybody.

Some examples are the [`@quid/react-ellipsis`][react-ellipsis] component, [`@quid/stylis-plugin-focus-visible`][stylis-plugin-focus-visible], [`@quid/react-mouse-outside`][react-mouse-outside], and all the packages marked by the _"Community"_ badge on our styleguide website.
